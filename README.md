## 📚 Background & Problem Statement
At AASTU, students rely heavily on two main cafeterias—**Central** and **KK**—for daily meals. Currently, ordering food means calling the cafeteria or waiting in long queues, which creates **frustration, delays, and high workload for staff**.  

🎯 **Goal:** Simplify and modernize the food-ordering process by creating an **interactive front-end website** where students can browse menus, choose their food, and select the cafeteria (KK or Central) for pickup.  

> Think of it as your **personal cafeteria assistant online!**  

---

## 🏆 Objectives
- Design a **clear, responsive, and user-friendly website**.  
- Implement **dynamic features**: menu browsing, cart management, and order forms with validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Allow users to **choose the cafeteria (KK or Central)** when placing an order.  
- Deliver a **working front-end prototype** ready for backend integration later.  

---

## 📌 Scope
**Cafeterias Covered:** Central and KK  
**Users:** Students & cafeteria staff  

**Phase 1 (Mini Project):**  
- Front-end prototype (HTML/CSS/JS) only  
- No database or server yet  

**Future Scope (Phase 2+):**  
- PHP backend & database for orders  
- Student authentication & order history  
- Admin dashboard for cafeterias  
- Notifications when orders are ready

## 🍔 Key Features (Functional Requirements)
1. **Home Page** – Quick links to cafeterias, featured menu items, and project branding.  
2. **Menu Pages** – Displays all food items with **images, descriptions, prices, and availability**.  
3. **Cafeteria Selection** – Students select **Central or KK** for their order.  
4. **Cart System** – Add/remove items, update quantities, see totals **dynamically**.  
5. **Order Form** – Collects student info (name, ID, contact, pickup cafeteria) with **JavaScript validation**.  
6. **Order Summary** – Shows final order details before confirmation (prototype phase: **no database yet**).  
7. **Responsive Design** – Works on **mobile and desktop** for on-the-go students.
