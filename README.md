# 🍴 AASTU Bite — Student Cafeteria Food Ordering System
*(Serving Central & KK cafeterias at AASTU — Phase 1 Prototype)*

---

## 🌟 Project Title
**AASTU Bite:** Student Cafeteria Food Ordering Website  

---

## 👥 Team / Organization
- **Organization:** AASTU Bite Team  
- **Course:** Internet Programming I (Mini Project)  
- **Institution:** Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU)  

---

## 📚 Introduction
AASTU Bite is a **web-based food ordering system** designed to simplify and modernize food ordering at AASTU. Students can browse menus, add items to a cart, select the cafeteria (Central or KK), and submit orders online.  

This system is a **Phase 1 prototype**, focusing on front-end features while preparing for **backend integration, GPS/map delivery, notifications, and mobile app expansion** in future phases.  

---

## 🌍 Context
At AASTU, students depend on multiple cafeterias for daily meals. Currently:  

- Ordering requires **calling the cafeteria or standing in long queues**  
- Staff face **high workloads and order management challenges**  
- Students experience **frustration and delays**, especially during peak hours  

The system will operate in the **university environment**, serving students and cafeteria staff, and will eventually expand to include all cafeterias with GPS delivery and backend support.  

---

## 🚀 Motivation
- Reduce waiting times and improve ordering convenience  
- Provide a **modern, interactive front-end solution**  
- Prepare for **future GPS/map-based delivery and mobile app integration**  
- Support cafeteria staff by reducing workload and errors in order handling

## 📄 SRS Overview of Existing System (beU Delivery)

### Use Case of Existing System (Reference)
**beU Delivery** is a commercial Ethiopian food delivery app:  
- Connects users with multiple restaurants  
- Offers app-based ordering, cart, payment, and GPS tracking  
- Digital wallet, discounts, and referral rewards  

**Actors:** Customers, Delivery Staff  

**Flow:**  
1. Customer selects restaurant and food → adds to cart → pays → tracks delivery  
2. Delivery staff receives order → picks up → delivers → updates status  

### Problems & Limitations
- Not campus-focused, only city-wide delivery  
- Requires mobile app and account creation  
- Delivery can be unreliable or slow  
- Does not handle cafeteria-specific ordering workflows
