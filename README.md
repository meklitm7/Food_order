# 🍽 SixPlates — AASTU Student Cafeteria Food Ordering System
*(Serving Central, Kibinash & KK cafeterias)*

---

## 🌟 Project Title
**SixPlates:** AASTU Student Cafeteria Food Ordering Website

---

## 👥 Team / Organization
- **Organization:** SixPlates  
- **Course:** Internet Programming I (Mini Project)  
- **Institution:** Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (AASTU)

## 📚 Background & Problem Statement
At AASTU, students often rely on three main cafeterias—**Central**, **Kibinash**, and **KK**—for daily meals. Currently, ordering food means calling the cafeteria, waiting in line, and manually tracking orders.  

This creates **frustration, wasted time, and stressed cafeteria staff**.  

🎯 **Goal:** Modernize the food-ordering workflow by building a **fun, simple, and interactive front-end website** where students can browse menus and place orders in a few clicks.  

> Think of it as your **cafeteria assistant in your pocket… but on a website!**  

---

## 🏆 Objectives
- Design a **clear, responsive, and visually friendly website**.  
- Implement **dynamic features**: menu browsing, cart management, and order forms with validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Deliver a **working prototype** ready for future backend integration.  
- Lay a roadmap for **Internet Programming II** with scalable ideas.  

---

## 📌 Scope
**Cafeterias Covered:** Central, Kibinash, and KK  
**Users:** Students & cafeteria staff  

**Phase 1 (Mini Project):**  
- Pure **front-end prototype** (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- No database or server yet  

**Future Scope (Phase 2+):**  
- PHP backend & database  
- Authentication & admin dashboard  
- Order history & notifications

## 🍔 Key Features (Functional Requirements)
1. **Home Page** – Quick cafeteria links, featured menu items, and project branding.  
2. **Cafeteria Menus** – Each cafeteria has its own page with **images, descriptions, prices, and availability**.  
3. **Cart System** – Add/remove items, update quantities, see totals in **real-time**.  
4. **Order Form** – Collects student info (name, ID, contact, pickup cafeteria) and **validates inputs** with JavaScript.  
5. **Order Summary** – Shows order details before confirmation (prototype phase: **no database yet**).  
6. **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on **mobile & desktop** for on-the-go students.

## ⚡ Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability:** Few clicks, fast browsing.  
- **Performance:** Lightweight, **loads in a flash**.  
- **Maintainability:** Clean, modular code ready for future backend integration.  

---

## 💻 Proposed Technology Stack (Phase 1)
- **Front-end:** HTML5, CSS3 (optionally Bootstrap), JavaScript (vanilla)  
- **Hosting:** Local or simple static hosting  
- **Future:** PHP + MySQL/SQLite + admin dashboard
